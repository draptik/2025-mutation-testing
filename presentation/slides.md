## Let's talk about "Metrics" ...

<v-clicks>

- <span v-mark.strike-through.gray="3">"If you can't measure it, you can't manage it"</span> - *attributed* to W. Edwards Deming ü§î
- "**It is wrong** to suppose that if you can't measure it, you can't manage it - **a costly myth**." - the actual quote by W. Edwards Deming,  [The New Economics (1993)](https://deming.org/myth-if-you-cant-measure-it-you-cant-manage-it/) üëÄ
</v-clicks>

<br/>

<v-clicks at="4">

- [**Campbell's Law**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/campbells-law) states that **the more important a metric is** in social decision making, the **more likely it is to be manipulated**.
- **Goodhart's Law** states that **"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."**

## Test coverage

<v-clicks>

- üéì defines the percentage of covered code
- ‚úÖ 100% test coverage means, every line of code is executed at least once
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 100% test coverage **does not mean that every scenario / use-case is covered**

</v-clicks>

---

## Is Test coverage a "good metric"?

- not every line of code needs to be tested
- BUT: having no tests is obviously also not a good idea
- anything above 60% is a good baseline (but, "it depends")
- test coverage does not tell us anything about the **quality** of the tests

## What is mutation testing?

[https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/)

<v-clicks>

- Mutation testing **introduces changes to your code**, then runs your unit tests against **the changed code**.
- the "change" is called a **mutant**
- If our test suite is ok for a "mutant:" Ups, we missed something

### Hello-World Example

::left::

Production code:

```cs
public string DoMagic(int i) => i < 18 ? "child" : "adult"
```

<div v-click>

- `dotnet stryker`
- it creates a mutant replacing `<` with `<=`

```cs
public string DoMagic(int i) => i <= 18 ? "child" : "adult"
```

</div>

<arrow v-click="[1]" x1="312" y1="110" x2="312" y2="140" color="red" width="2" arrowSize="1" />
<arrow v-click="[1]" x1="315" y1="310" x2="315" y2="280" color="red" width="2" arrowSize="1" />

<div v-click="[2]">

- The mutant "survived"
- The mutant did not provoke a test failure!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Our test suite might not be good enough! ‚ö†Ô∏è

</div>

::right::

Test suite (**100% code coverage!**):

```cs
[Theory]
[InlineData(10, "child")]
[InlineData(20, "adult")]
public void DoMagic_works(int input, string expected)
{
  DoMagic(input).Should().Be(expected)
}
```

<img
  v-click="[2]"
  class="absolute bottom-5 right-75 h-60"
  src="/images/mutant-monster2.jpg"
/>

<style>
.col-bottom {
  align-self: end;
  grid-area: 3 / 1 / 4 / 3; /* Adjust this to correctly place the bottom area */
}
.two-cols-header {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  column-gap: 20px; /* Adjust the gap size as needed */
}
</style>

## Mutations

Let's have a look at mutations: [https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/mutations/](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/mutations/)

Most mutations are language agnostic

Some are optimized for .NET:

- [Initializers](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/mutations/#initialization-initializer)
- [Removal](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/mutations/#removal-mutators-statement-block)
- [Linq](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/mutations/#linq-methods-linq)
- [Null-coalescing Operators](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/mutations/#null-coalescing-operators-nullcoalescing)

## Isn't this slow?

<v-clicks>

- Short answer: YES
- BUT: **These frameworks have smart heuristics for short circuiting**
- CI: Don't include this in normal commits
- CI: use "Nightly", or local (for **exploratory analysis**)
- Google uses Mutation Testing on really large projects: <https://research.google/pubs/practical-mutation-testing-at-scale-a-view-from-google/>
  - "[...] a codebase of **two billion lines of code** and more than **150,000,000 tests**"
  - "[...] used by more than **24,000 developers** on more than **1,000 projects**"
  - It is still slow, but not as slow as you might think

## Mutation Strategies

ü§î How do these frameworks optimize performance?

[https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/technical-reference/research/#comparison](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/technical-reference/research/#comparison)

- mutate **source code**
- mutate **byte code**
- **mutant schemata** (aka "mutant switching")

üëâ Stryker.NET uses "mutant schemata"

## Fine-Tuning

üîß Stryker provides many bells & whistles for fine-tuning using either [CLI or config file](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/configuration/).

<v-clicks>

Some examples:

- [`mutate`](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/configuration/#mutate-glob): Globbing patterns for including/excluding
- [`test-case-filter`](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/configuration/#test-case-filter-string): filter selective subset(s) of tests
- [`mutation-level`](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/configuration/#mutation-level-level): high level categories (`Basic`, `Standard`, `Advanced`, `Complete`)
- [`coverage-analysis`](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/configuration/#coverage-analysis-string): short circuit logic vs "everything in isolation"

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

Also nice: use git as baseline, only test things that have changed recently

- [`since`](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/configuration/#since-flag-committish): git "committish" (i.e. commit hash, tag, etc)
- [`with-baseline`](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/configuration/#with-baseline-flag-committish) (experimental): similar to `since`, but uses previous reports

</v-clicks>

## What about F#?

- The team noticed they had to rearchitect the framework (.NET is not only C#)
- This is a good thing!
- Strategy is clearly communicated!
